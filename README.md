# AmericanUnitConverter
Converts Metric to and from American Units (NOT IMPERIAL)                    
Inspired by my fellow Americans, and their inability to understand why metric is so much better, and how they will use literally anything else instead!
App made using Python, website made using JS/HTML             
The website is the most updated version with extra features, so I would suggest using that.      
Made for Hack Club High Seas.
